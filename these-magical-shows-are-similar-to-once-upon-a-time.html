They play characters stuck in a messy love triangle for a large portion of the series, but eventually, they are collectively able to decide which pairing is fate.

Instead of giving in to villainous impulses, they must learn how to control their urges to follow an ethical code. Since this show is a spin-off based around two successful series, fans had extremely high expectations for it — and the show creators never let anyone down.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Legacies can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CW</a> or rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Witches of East End (2013)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>Witches of East End is a fascinating supernatural drama that premiered in 2013.

At first, McCall is unsure if he can still consider himself a human or if he will completely transition into a werewolf.
