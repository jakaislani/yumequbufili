It has been reported by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $4 million, as of the data presented in early 2018. Film, television and music are the sources of Sturgess’ modest fortune.</p><h3>Jim Sturgess Net Worth $4 million</h3><p>To begin with, Sturgess grew up in Farnham, Surrey, and was educated at Frensham Heights School. He received his further education at the University of Salford.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, he worked at the National Youth Music Theatre in London from 1993 to 1995. In his first film role he played alongside <a href=#>Albert Finney</a>, <a href=#>Greta Scacchi</a>, <a href=#>Matthew Modine</a> and Julian Sands in the drama film “The Browning Version” (1994) by Mike Figgis, then played minor roles in several British TV series and independent films, and concurrently became a member of two bands including Dilated Spies and Saint Faith, but as both dissolved, he began to focus more on acting.</p><p>Jim played one of the major roles alongside Ciarán Hinds in the television drama film “Thursday the 12th” (2000). In the musical film “Across the Universe” (2007) Sturgess took the lead role of an English dock worker, who travels to the United States and falls in love there. The release of the film drama “The Other Boleyn Girl”, in which he played alongside <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> and <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>, was scheduled in 2008, and the same year he played one of his most famous roles in the film “21” (2008), in which he embodied an MIT student who earns millions by card counting in the casinos of Las Vegas. In the film “Crossing Over” (2009), the actor played alongside <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a>, <a href=#>Ray Liotta</a> and <a href=#>Ashley Judd</a>, depicting people from various countries who have immigrated to the US and tried to become naturalized. The same year, “50 Dead Men Walking” was released, in which he portrayed a young Irishman charged by the British police to spy on the IRA, saving the lives of over 50 people. For his role in the horror film “Heartless” (2009) by Philip Ridley, Sturgess received the Best Actor Award 2010 at the Fantasporto Film Festival. In the adventure drama “The Way Back” (2011) by <a href=#>Peter Weir</a>, Sturgess played alongside <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a> and <a href=#>Ed Harris</a>; the film is set in World War II, and he breaks out with a group of prisoners from a Russian extermination camp and runs with them from Siberia to non-communist India. In 2011, Jim starred opposite Anne Hathawaythe in the film “One Day”, and other notable film projects have been “Upside Down” (2013), “Stonehearst Asylum” (2013) and “Kidnapping Freddy Heineken” (2014). Recently, he starred in the disaster film “Geostorm” (2017) written, produced and directed by <a href=#>Dean Devlin</a> – the reviews were average, yet the film grossed $217 million at the box office with a budget of $120 million. In 2018, the film “JT LeRoy” with Jim Sturgess is going to be released, and currently, he is working on the set of the upcoming film “London Fields”.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the actor, Sturgess was in a relationship with <a href=#>Bae Doona</a> from 2014 to ’15, but is still single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.254071661238><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jim Sturgess</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 16, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>London, England</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.84 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Salford</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Peter J.
