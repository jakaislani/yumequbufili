I don’t think there is. Back when I was little and Takis hadn’t made it to the U.S., Lay’s hadn’t attempted to concoct a New York Reuben flavor, and people were scared the world was going to end because computers didn’t understand zeros, sour cream and onion was the most interesting and delicious chip flavor out there. And let me tell you, it holds up.</p><p>But are Lay’s Sour Cream & Onion the sour cream and onion snack that most closely resembles the taste of real sour cream mixed with real onion? On a 2017 episode of Good Mythical Morning, Rhett & Link set out to answer this very question and decide which sour cream and onion snacks taste the most like sour cream and onion.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

And Rhett pointed out that after all the other sour cream and onion things they tried, this one was particularly weak—and also the most reminiscent of packing peanuts. Link eventually tasted the onion but really doubled down on the fact&nbsp;that these were more garlicky than oniony. They did like these though.</p><strong>Special K Sour Cream and Onion Cracker Chips</strong><p>These looked kind of like Pop Chips. Rhett’s first reaction? Two raised eyebrows followed by the observation that these are “super strong but in all the wrong ways.” Then he said he still liked them, so who knows what to conclude there. On the flavor-accuracy front, the guys concluded these were not good at all (and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it appears they’ve been discontinued).</p><strong>Pringles Sour Cream & Onion</strong><p>These had a subtle sour cream and onion flavor that struggled to make an impression. Rhett thought the flavor powder lacked creaminess, saying, “I know creaminess is a texture, but it feels like a taste in my heart right now, you know what I mean?” No, not really, but overall these had a hint of sour cream and onion, not enough for them to rank high.</p><strong>Flavor Blasted Slammin’ Sour Cream & Onion Goldfish</strong><p>As Rhett pointed out, that’s a lot of adjectives for one little fish-shaped cracker. But was the taste accurate? Well, it was “very strong but very strange.” Upon further inspection, however, they decided these did a pretty good job of embodying the flavor of real sour cream and onion. The intensity was right, but the accuracy wasn’t that different from Pringles.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kernel Season’s Sour Cream & Onion Popcorn Seasoning</strong></a><p>This popcorn seasoning was almost overpowered by the flavor of the popcorn itself. Naturally, Rhett & Link went ahead and tried the powder on its own, and said it was, and I quote, “tasty” and “pretty accurate, though.” Plus, with all the white powder right under their noses, it looked like they were having a ~great time~ with this one.</p><strong>Lay’s Sour Cream & Onion</strong><p>Rhett called these the king of sour cream and onion-flavored things, while Link said Lay’s Sour Cream & Onion are his “flavorite chip, period.” Yes, he actually said “flavorite.” Plus, the bowl of sour cream and onion on the bag looked just like their real-life bowl of sour cream mixed with scallions—a good sign, to be sure. Rhett even dipped one of the chips into his bowl of sour cream and scallions and said the experience and flavor didn’t change all that much from just the chip flavor. Link disagreed and thought the chip was better on its own. Impressive!</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crick-ettes Sour Cream & Onion Flavor</a></strong><p>Yup, they ate crickets. This video was part of that era of GMM. But did the crickets taste like sour cream and onion? Yes. Yes, they did. The flavor was apparently “very subtle, but very accurate” and “not half bad.” Okay, sure. Will I be trying these, however? No, I will not. All the same, Rhett & Link concluded that these taste “exactly like sour cream and onion,” so we’ll just have to take their word for it. Unless you’re brave enough to eat crickets, in which case, more power to ya.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="What's The Best Sour Cream & Onion Snack?
