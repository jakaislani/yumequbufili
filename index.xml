Cooling temperatures throughout the drivetrain will not only keep a car running longer, but will potentially help it run quicker. Does a cooler running engine make more power? The Verdict: Hotter engines make more power. Sure, cooler air and fuel is denser, meaning more of it can fill combustion chambers to make more power, but once detonated, less energy (heat, in this case) being absorbed by engine material and coolant means more of it can be put toward forward motion.</description></item><item><title>Is The Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner Jewish?</title><link>/is-the-golden-bachelor-gerry-turner-jewish.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/is-the-golden-bachelor-gerry-turner-jewish.html</guid><description>In a reality television landscape plagued by controversial flagship series and even more controversial stars (ahem, Ramona Singer), ABC‚Äôs first-ever edition of The Golden Bachelor is a rare bright spot.
