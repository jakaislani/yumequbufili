The fallout had to do with a un-aired portion of his first-round audition in which Judge Mel B deemed one of Failla’s jokes “racist” only to have the crowd stage a revolt on his behalf.</p><p>Despite Mel’s protests, judges Howard Stern, Heidi Klum, along with Howie Mandel voted Failla on to the Las Vegas round, setting off a wild celebration at the Hammerstein Ballroom.</p><p>Although that set never aired, it was covered by over a hundred news outlets, including TMZ, Perez Hilton, as well as CBS’s The Talk. The incident also resurfaced on the Howard Stern Show later that summer when comic Lisa Lampanelli criticized Mel B as well as voiced her support of Failla.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jimmy-failla-fox-news-radio-podcast></span><span>Jimmy Failla Fox News Radio | Podcast</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In June 2006 Failla made the first of countless appearances on Sirius XM’s Maxim Radio.
