Cooling temperatures throughout the drivetrain will not only keep a car running longer, but will potentially help it run quicker. Does a cooler running engine make more power? The Verdict: Hotter engines make more power. Sure, cooler air and fuel is denser, meaning more of it can fill combustion chambers to make more power, but once detonated, less energy (heat, in this case) being absorbed by engine material and coolant means more of it can be put toward forward motion.</p><footer><a href=../../does-a-cooler-engine-run-better.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../is-the-golden-bachelor-gerry-turner-jewish.html>Is The Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner Jewish?</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
