When the paper was expanded and renamed PanAfrica, he became its editor-in-chief. In 1963 he was elected as one of Kenya’s representatives in the Central Legislative Assembly of the East African Common Services Organisation.</p><p>Pinto, on his part, had almost nothing to his name. His wife, Emma, was the family’s breadwinner. Their home in Nairobi’s Lower Kabete Road was a gift from an admirer.</p><p>After Pinto was assassinated in 1965, Emma was shocked to find that there was no money in the bank account to pay the rent.</p><p>He had reportedly been warned earlier that his life was in danger because powerful forces in government were unhappy with his activities, but he refused to flee the country.</p><p>He was shot as he drove out of his home and a certain Kisilu Mutua was arrested and convicted for the killing.</p><p>His assassination was the first in post-independence Kenya.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLe1w56mZpyZmLhus9GenqiqqWKyubzLmqCnq12stbp5zJqjnKeconq5v4ykoKWklafAbsPEq5xmqJ%2BowKquy7Jkm52Ynrulec%2BipmafkaKubrzIp6uoq12WwLSt0qygp5mknryvew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-harry-potters-girl-best-friend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-harry-potters-girl-best-friend.html>Who is Harry Potter's girl best friend?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paul-vu-net-worth-176576.html>Paul Vu Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paul-vu-net-worth-176576.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
